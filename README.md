# Robo Speaker README

## Introduction
The Robo Speaker is a simple Python program that utilizes the `pyttsx3` library to convert text input into speech. It allows you to enter text, and the program will read it out loud. This README provides essential information about how to use the Robo Speaker code.

## Requirements
Before running the Robo Speaker, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python: You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Robo Speaker code.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the Robo Speaker:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Robo Speaker code.
3. Run the code by executing the following command:

```

4. The program will start, and you will see the message "Welcome to the Robo Speaker created by VS."

5. Enter the text you want the program to speak. Type "q" and press Enter to exit the program.
